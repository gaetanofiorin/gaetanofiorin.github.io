            <p>As a linguist, I'm interested in the study of language as a part of human cognition. My research is in theoretical linguistics (particularly model-theoretic semantics and the syntax-semantics interface), experimental linguistics (in particular, language development and language impairments) and the philosophy of language (in particular, the metaphysics of meaning and the interface between language and other cognitive domains such as sensorial perception and music). I am professor of General Linguistics at the Department of Humanities (DISU) of the University of Trieste, Italy. I've studied at the University of Verona, Italy, and at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. I have also worked at Utrecht University between 2010 and 2022.</p>

            <p><a href="#Top">(Back to top)</a></p>
            <p>I love music, in all its forms and incarnations. In recent years, I have dedicated myself to composing and performing electronic music. I became especially interested in generative compositional processes and explorative/transcendental conceptions of musical practice. I make my music mainly using a modular synthesizer. Occasionaly I also play guitar, bass and drums. I'm cofounder of the artistic collective and digital label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundofatem" target="_blank">Effortless Art</a>.</p>
