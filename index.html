            <p>I study language as part of human cognition.</p>
            <p>My research is in theoretical linguistics (particularly model-theoretic semantics and the syntax-semantics interface), experimental linguistics (in particular, language development and language impairments) and the philosophy of language (in particular, the metaphysics of meaning and the interface between language and other cognitive system such as sensorial perception and music). I am professor of General Linguistics at the Department of Humanities (DISU) of the University of Trieste, Italy. I've studied at the University of Verona, Italy, and at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. I have also worked at Utrecht University from 2010 until 2022.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/17294/" target="_blank">Possessive binding in copulars</a> (2025, w/Denis Delfitto)<br><small>Given the early nineteenth-century view according to which the copula is ambiguous between identity and predication, (pronominal) binding facts in copular structures have been taken to be evidence for a unified predicational analysis. This contribution supports the claim that binominal copulars are not ambiguous, while rejecting the familiar hypothesis that one of the DPs involved is necessarily a predicate. First, we show that binding of possessive pronouns is in fact generally allowed in binominal copulars, contrary to the received wisdom. Second, we show this to be compatible only with rejecting Longobardi and Moro’s small-clause analysis, whereby one of the two DPs is a predicate, and with adopting the view that the two DPs are related by an abstract head, which we interpret as a silent predicate of asymmetric identification. We further argue that the cases in which binding is illegitimate involve strict identity under pragmatic strengthening, whose result is semantically awkward and can only be rescued in pragmatically supportive contexts.</small></p>

Similarly to other pragmatic approaches to fiction and fictional contexts, we maintain that fictional texts require that the interpreter engages in a game of pretense of sort and are, therefore, prescriptions to imagine a state of affairs that is not the real one. In contrast to these approaches, however, we propose that interpreting a fictional text does not require imagining a set of possible state of affairs where the text would be true but, rather, requires imagining a set of possible contexts where the text would be meaningful. In order to apply this framework to fictional names, we adopt a contextual theory of proper names, which we have proposed and defended in previous work.</small></p>

In this contribution, we present the hypothesis that syncopation is an effective strategy to elicit the bootstrapping of a multi-layered, hierarchically organized metric structure from a linear rhythmic surface. The hypothesis is inspired by a parallel with the problem of linearization in natural language syntax, which is the problem of how hierarchically organized phrase-structure markers are mapped onto linear sequences of words. The hypothesis has important consequences for the role of meter in music perception and cognition and, more particularly, for its role in the relationship between rhythm and bodily entrainment.</small></p>

Our proposal is based on a cognitively grounded notion of identity as identification of one object on the basis of the properties of another. We argue that our proposal is preferable over Russell's view that the copula is ambiguous between a predicative interpretation (as in “Socrates is wise”) and an equative one (as in “Socrates is a man”) but also improves upon Longobardi's and Moro's influential analyses, which entail that DP's are ambiguous between a referring type (<e > or < et>t>) and a predicational type (<et>). In the new analysis proposed here, copular structures receive a uniform predicational interpretations and DPs are uniformly interpreted as referential.</small></p>

            <p>I love music, in all its forms and incarnations. In recent years, I have dedicated myself to composing and performing electronic music. I became especially interested in generative compositional processes and explorative/transcendental conceptions of musical practice. I make my music mainly using a modular synthesizer. Occasionaly I also play guitar, bass and drums. I'm cofounder of the artistic collective and digital label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundofatem" target="_blank">Effortless Art</a>.</p>
