This contribution supports the claim that binominal copulars are not ambiguous, while rejecting the familiar hypothesis that one of the DPs involved is necessarily a predicate. First, we show that binding of possessive pronouns is in fact generally allowed in binominal copulars, contrary to the received wisdom. Second, we show this to be compatible only with rejecting Longobardi and Moro’s small-clause analysis, whereby one of the two DPs is a predicate, and with adopting the view that the two DPs are related by an abstract head, which we interpret as a silent predicate of asymmetric identification. We further argue that the cases in which binding is illegitimate involve strict identity under pragmatic strengthening, whose result is semantically awkward and can only be rescued in pragmatically supportive contexts.</small></p>

Similarly to other pragmatic approaches to fiction and fictional contexts, we maintain that fictional texts require that the interpreter engages in a game of pretense of sort and are, therefore, prescriptions to imagine a state of affairs that is not the real one. In contrast to these approaches, however, we propose that interpreting a fictional text does not require imagining a set of possible state of affairs where the text would be true but, rather, requires imagining a set of possible contexts where the text would be meaningful. In order to apply this framework to fictional names, we adopt a contextual theory of proper names, which we have proposed and defended in previous work.</small></p>

In this contribution, we present the hypothesis that syncopation is an effective strategy to elicit the bootstrapping of a multi-layered, hierarchically organized metric structure from a linear rhythmic surface. The hypothesis is inspired by a parallel with the problem of linearization in natural language syntax, which is the problem of how hierarchically organized phrase-structure markers are mapped onto linear sequences of words. The hypothesis has important consequences for the role of meter in music perception and cognition and, more particularly, for its role in the relationship between rhythm and bodily entrainment.</small></p>

Our proposal is based on a cognitively grounded notion of identity as identification of one object on the basis of the properties of another. We argue that our proposal is preferable over Russell's view that the copula is ambiguous between a predicative interpretation (as in “Socrates is wise”) and an equative one (as in “Socrates is a man”) but also improves upon Longobardi's and Moro's influential analyses, which entail that DP's are ambiguous between a referring type (e or et,t) and a predicational type (et). In the new analysis proposed here, copular structures receive a uniform predicational interpretations and DPs are uniformly interpreted as referential.</small></p>

This analysis has important across-the-board virtues. It reduces the distance between common nouns and names, under the insight that names are a highly specific case of a more general phenomenon consisting in the pragmatic modulation of the meaning of common nouns. It successfully ties to an important body of syntactic evidence, and contributes to elucidate, in an original and productive manner, many of the unsolved issues concerning the syntactic structure of (complex) names. Finally, it makes a number of philosophical puzzles virtually dissolve without giving up rigid reference for names, but crucially suggesting that the causal theory of reference becomes far-fetched once the linguistic structure of names and their actual use in language and cognition have been carefully evaluated.</small></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.mulino.it/isbn/9788815298843" target="_blank">Interfaccia pragmatica e sintassi</a> (2022, w/Denis Delfitto)<br><small>Nell’approccio più consueto al linguaggio, la sintassi è stata vista come lo strumento primario dell’interpretazione composizionale del significato proposizionale (Montague [1973]; Heim e Kratzer [1998]). La pragmatica, sia come livello di interazione fra segni e utilizzatori [Morris 1946], sia come livello inferenziale del significato relativo a ciò che è implicato [Grice 1975], per definizione più ricco del contenuto proposizionale minimale di un enunciato, è stata di conseguenza tradizionalmente concepita come estranea alla sintassi e complementare a quest’ultima nell’ambito dei processi di scomposizione del contenuto comunicativo delle produzioni linguistiche. In questo capitolo vedremo invece che la sintassi è attiva nella codifica di processi di interpretazione inferenziale/contestuale. In questo senso, i fatti che considereremo costituiscono una sorta di correlato alla tesi − tipica del pragmatismo radicale − che sia assai arduo identificare il significato proposizionale con gli aspetti non-contestuali e non-inferenziali del significato: non solo esiste una dimensione pragmatica del significato proposizionale, ma è anzi la sintassi stessa a codificare l’applicazione di alcuni degli aspetti contestuali del significato. Per ragioni di spazio, ci concentreremo qui su un solo caso studio: la possibile soluzione sintattica di alcuni fra i problemi, notoriamente assai ostici, sollevati dalla pragmatica del pronome di prima persona.</small></p>

This linguistic analysis of the visual-pictorial modality explores the distribution of thematic and discourse roles as an authorly tool to express meaning. Findings include that the linear order of figures in the frescoes is patterned according to semantic principles and has been used here to convey particular relations, roles and other semantic information. Findings of this analysis can be fruitful both for the field of Art History and that of Linguistics, by offering insights into the potential application of linguistic patterning in narrative imagery, into the functions of artworks in this period, and how they combine their aesthetic, theological and communicative functions. The interdisciplinary methodology proposed here pioneers a new field of academic inquiry, for which future directives are provided.</small></p>

We build up on some of Frege's concerns about the first-person, recently revived by Kripke as a criticism of the position according to which Kaplan's two-dimensional semantics is all is needed for an adequate semantics of the first-person. First, we discuss the so-called pragmatic approach to Moore's paradox, discussing its possible limitations, in accordance with some ideas expressed on the matter by Shoemaker. Second, we show that sentences where a predicate expressing a “phenomenal” property combines with a first-person pronoun are bound to express Stalnaker's diagonal proposition, and are true a priori. Crucially, the proposition expressed does not correspond to the ascription of a property to an independently established object. Finally, we provide significant empirical evidence to the effect that this emerging “subjective” layer of meaning is actually what is needed to solve some of the puzzles around Moore's paradox: the status of Moore's sentences essentially depends, in fact, on the interaction between the “objective” and the “subjective” layers of meaning.</small></p>

As is well-known, these contexts give rise to the phenomenon of ‘immunity to error through misidentification’ (IEM): the utterer of (i) cannot be mistaken as to whether he is the person having a toothache. We provide a series of arguments in favor of a principled distinction between a de facto IEM, grounded in perceptual and proprioceptive judgments, and a de iure IEM, grounded in experience reports whereby the experience wears the experiencer on its sleeve. From this perspective, the no-referent account of subject “I” advocated by Wittgenstein/Anscombe is correct. In fact, we show how this analysis can be made compatible with a Kaplanian account of first-person indexicals, by identifying the speaker in the context of utterance with the person who has access to the reported private experience.</small></p>

According to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis, this phonological deficit is caused by deficient cerebellar function. In the current study, 26 adults with developmental dyslexia and 25 non-dyslexic participants underwent testing of reading-related skills, cerebellar functions, and MRI scanning of the brain. Anatomical assessment of the cerebellum was conducted with voxel-based morphometry. Behavioural evidence, that was indicative of impaired cerebellar function, was found to co-occur with reading impairments in the dyslexic subjects, but a causal relation between the two was not observed. No differences in local grey matter volume, nor in structure-function relationships within the cerebellum were found between the two groups. Possibly, the observed behavioural pattern is due to aberrant white matter connectivity. In conclusion, no support for the cerebellar deficit hypothesis or the presence of anatomical differences of the cerebellum in adults with developmental dyslexia was found.</small></p>

We propose that control structures are the result of an operation of Thematic Overwriting (TO), which conflates two thematic roles into one and delivers a logical representation whereby two properties are predicated of a unique argument. The account we propose explains a number of facts concerning control structures: (i) The fact that control structures are bound to the expression of de se attitudes; (ii) that fact that some control structures – more precisely, those control structures involving an Experiencer subject – are bound to the expression of implicit de se attitudes, that is, de se propositional attitudes that are immune to error through misidentification; (iii) the contrast between optional and non-optional control; (iv) the contrast between partial and exhaustive control. The account we propose also predicts a diachronic constraint on the emergence of control structures, whereby TO first emerges in the context of implicit de se attitudes and only later is extended to other de se contexts. This prediction is supported by the attested development of control structures from Old English (OE) through early Modern English (ENE) and Middle English (ME) to Modern English.</small></p>

Sixteen bilingual children and 16 Italian monolingual peers were tested using a truth-value judgment task. All children showed greater difficulties in the comprehension of True negatives, indicating that the difficulties in the processing of negation, in the relevant experimental conditions, have a general validity across the two groups. This result can be readily interpreted in the light of the “experiential” theories of negation processing, by means of the two-step simulation hypothesis. In addition, it should be emphasized that bilingual children were more accurate in the comprehension of True negatives than monolingual children, a finding that deserves further investigation.</small></p>

Results from a production experiment showed that the two differ prosodically: FWhEQs start low, rise later (the pitch accent was realized on the verb participle) and end with a high boundary tone, whereas WhQs in most of the cases start with a rise, followed by a small plateau and end with a rise or a low F0. At the syntactic level we argue that a FWhEQ moves as a whole to the specifier of a TopicP within a higher superordinate ForceP. At the semantic level, we propose that FWhEQs differ from regular WhQs in that they express a meta speech act: with a FWhEQ the speaker asks the addressee to repeat an assertion. We formalize this idea arguing that the movement of the whole ForceP to a higher ForceP, together with the obligatory final rising intonation, activates a REQUEST operator in the superordinate ForceP. The REQUEST operator is a meta speech act as it applies to another speech act, rather than to a sentence radical.</small></p>

This study looks at how young poor readers, speakers of Mandarin Chinese, comprehend affirmative and negative sentences as compared with a group of age-matched typical readers. Forty-four Chinese children were tested with a truth value judgment task. The results reveal that negative sentences were harder to process than affirmative ones, irrespective of the distinction between poor and typical readers. Moreover, poor readers performed worse than typical readers in comprehending sentences, regardless of whether they were affirmative or negative sentences. We interpret the results as (a) confirming the two-step simulation hypothesis, based on the result that the difficulty in processing negation has a general validity (persisting in pragmatically felicitous contexts), and (b) disconfirming that negation, as far as behavioral data are concerned, can be used as a reliable linguistic predictor of reading difficulties.</small></p>

The event-based approach maintains that imperfective and perfective refer to different classes of events. The perspective-based approach maintains that imperfective and perfective encode different perspectives towards otherwise ontologically and metaphysically equivalent events. The event-based approach is preferable over the perspective-based approach because it accounts for the imperfective paradox, that is, for the fact that imperfective and progressive morphology make it possible to use a telic predicate like ‘drive to Bordeaux’, which is defined by its endpoint, reaching Bordeaux, to describe an event that is only a partial event of driving to Bordeaux. The perspective-based approach, on the other hand, is supported by experimental findings on the acquisition of the meaning of the imperfective. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to the progressive/imperfective that can account both for the imperfective paradox and the experimental findings. The proposal is based on two main ideas: (i) as in the perspective-based approach, the role of the progressive and imperfective is to present events from an internal perspective, whereas the role of the perfective is to present events from an external perspective; (ii) progressive and imperfective sentences involve quantification over inertia worlds, as in the modal variant of the event-based approach; however, the modal import of progressive sentences is not brought about by the progressive operator, but is a property of telic predicates themselves.</small></p>

                <p><a href="https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-3102-8" target="_blank">The semantics of person and de se effects in free indirect discourse</a> (2016, w/Denis Delfitto, Anne Reboul)<br><small>In this contribution we will address the main puzzling empirical issues that have been formulated around Free Indirect Discourse (FID): the constraints on the use of first person pronouns and of proper names (as well as of definite descriptions), the reasons why different grammatical features (person, gender, number) give rise to presuppositions that must be resolved at different levels of interpretation in FID, the factors that account for the observation that person and tense behave similarly in FID. At the same time, we will also discuss the main controversies to which the ongoing debate on FID has given rise in the literature, showing that Schlenker (Mind Lang 19(3):279–304, 2004)’s distinction between a Context of Thought (CT) and a Context of Utterance (CU) still provides a fundamentally valid insight into the nature of FID, in spite of many qualifications that are necessary and some well-motivated criticism. However, our main task here is more ambitious than simply taking a stand on the many unsettled controversies surrounding FID. In fact, we claim that Schlenker’s split between CU and CT can be derived in a principled way from the inner nature of FID as a linguistic process of ‘phenomenal identification’, whereby a Higher Experiencer attempts at reproducing (at a distinct time) the phenomenal experience proper to a Lower Experiencer. This distinction between qualitatively identified but numerically distinct experiences provides the conceptual basis for the derivation of virtually all remarkable properties of FID (including its somehow intermediate status between Direct and Indirect Discourse), while connecting, at the same time, with some intriguing semantic properties of first-person pronouns, such as the different varieties of de se readings.</small></p>

It seems to be a mixture of both direct discourse (in allowing exclamatives, interrogatives, etc.) and indirect discourse (in following sequences of tenses and pronouns). It has been the object of more interest from literary theorists than from linguists, though Banfield (1982) offered what is still the best syntactic description of the phenomenon, and contemporary semantic accounts have brought new insights into it. Schlenker (2004) made decisive progress in proposing an account of two contexts and indexical shifting. Maier (2015) proposes an alternative quotational analyses, which Eckardt (2015) rejects, going back to Schlenker's model, suitably amended to answer Maier's criticism. We present these theories, criticize them, and propose an extension of the Schlenker–Eckardt model.</small></p>

In such a framework, defining the meaning of a natural language expression corresponds to defining the object to which it refers, a practice sometimes referred to as ‘Natural Language Metaphysics’. Typical objects of reference used in semantic modeling are individual entities and possible worlds. A number of linguistic facts have been explained by introducing novel classes of entities in the model. Relevant examples are times and events. In this contribution, we aim at producing a case for introducing phenomenal experiences among the set of objects natural language expressions refer to. We show that the truth conditions of some natural language expressions are best described as denoting phenomenal experiences, rather than objects of the world.</small></p>

In this article, we review and criticize Higginbotham’s reflexive analysis of these infinitival complements. We also show that the type of criticism we raise against Higginbotham’s account applies likewise to analyses based on the use of acquaintance relations and centered possible worlds. Finally, following recent ideas in cognitive science, we propose an amendment to Higginbotham’s account based on the idea that the thematic-role “Experiencer” corresponds to a function mapping events into “minimal selves”, in the sense of Shaun Gallagher.</small></p>

We argue that it is exactly these interface conditions that enable different kinds of exclamatives (belonging to different clause-types) to receive their fine-grained interpretation. Syntactically, the core of our proposal is that there are two sorts of activation of the degree-feature in the syntax of exclamatives, giving rise to two distinct syntactic dependencies, and that the so-called ‘nominal’ exclamatives correspond in fact to clausal structures. The overall picture combines empirical adequacy with theoretical elegance and parsimony, pointing to a new interesting dimension in the semantics of definite determiners and – more generally – maximality operators.</small></p>

This type of negation differs from canonical negation in that it does not contribute its canonical meaning as a propositional operator, occurs higher in the syntactic structure of the clause, does not license negative polarity items, and expresses a bias towards the opposite polarity. In this article, we show that these properties are also found in negative rhetorical questions. We propose that exclamatives, as well as rhetorical questions, denote sets of propositions structured into Boolean algebras, with the negation imposing an order of informativity upon such structures.</small></p>

This idea has had little impact on semantic theories of indexicals. The reason is that indexicals are regarded, after Kaplan’s (1989) Logic of Demonstratives (LD), as directly referential and rigid. However, the phenomenon of shifted indexicality (Schlenker 2004) cast doubts on LD and, in particular, on the assumption that the descriptive content of indexical terms has no truth-conditional importance. Any extension (or reformulation) of LD that meets this empirical challenge must in fact allow the descriptive content of indexicals to interact with scope taking operators such as verba dicendi. Moreover, such a theory must account for the restrictions on these interactions. For instance, shifting-friendly languages allow indexicals to shift only in the scope of specific verbs (Anand 2006). In this contribution we show that LP offers an empirically adequate account of indexical shifting. We propose that: (a) indexical features (such as first-person features) are presuppositional; (b) indexicals features are hosted in the position in the left-periphery that is devoted to the representation of the context of utterance. The proposal shows that a presuppositional analysis is able to provide an elegant modeling of the indexical shifting, if we are ready to develop the basic insight that syntax has precise ways to encode presuppositional values and their locus of resolution. Furthermore, our syntax-oriented presuppositional approach makes good prospects for individuating the logical roots of two-dimensionalism in the semantics of indexicals, in a theory-independent way.</small></p>

We argue that first person interpretations of third person pronouns (de se readings) stem from the option of leaving the referential index underspecified on the pronoun, thus accounting for the interplay of this phenomenon with the anaphoric usage of first person indexicals (pronoun shifting) and logophoric pronouns. The results include proposals on the connection between the semantics of first person and the syntax of the left periphery, a neo-Davidsonian treatment of the semantics of first person indexicals, and a novel view of pronominal anaphora according to which Higginbotham's (1983) asymmetric relation of linking involves a mechanism of θ-role inheritance tied to the semantics of first person.</small></p>

            <p>I love music, in all its forms and incarnations. In recent years, I have dedicated myself to composing and performing electronic music. I became especially interested in generative compositional processes and explorative/transcendental conceptions of musical practice. I make my music mainly using a modular synthesizer. Occasionaly, I play guitar, bass and drums and code audio/visuals. I'm cofounder of the artistic collective and digital label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundofatem" target="_blank">Effortless Art</a>.</p>
