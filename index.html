            <p>I study language as part of human cognition.</p>
            <p>My research is in theoretical linguistics (particularly model-theoretic semantics and the syntax-semantics interface), experimental linguistics (in particular, language development and language impairments) and the philosophy of language (in particular, the metaphysics of meaning and the interface between language and other cognitive system such as sensorial perception and music). I am professor of General Linguistics at the Department of Humanities (DISU) of the University of Trieste, Italy. I've studied at the University of Verona, Italy, and at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. I have also worked at Utrecht University from 2010 until 2022.</p>

This contribution supports the claim that binominal copulars are not ambiguous, while rejecting the familiar hypothesis that one of the DPs involved is necessarily a predicate. First, we show that binding of possessive pronouns is in fact generally allowed in binominal copulars, contrary to the received wisdom. Second, we show this to be compatible only with rejecting Longobardi and Moro’s small-clause analysis, whereby one of the two DPs is a predicate, and with adopting the view that the two DPs are related by an abstract head, which we interpret as a silent predicate of asymmetric identification. We further argue that the cases in which binding is illegitimate involve strict identity under pragmatic strengthening, whose result is semantically awkward and can only be rescued in pragmatically supportive contexts.</small></p>

Similarly to other pragmatic approaches to fiction and fictional contexts, we maintain that fictional texts require that the interpreter engages in a game of pretense of sort and are, therefore, prescriptions to imagine a state of affairs that is not the real one. In contrast to these approaches, however, we propose that interpreting a fictional text does not require imagining a set of possible state of affairs where the text would be true but, rather, requires imagining a set of possible contexts where the text would be meaningful. In order to apply this framework to fictional names, we adopt a contextual theory of proper names, which we have proposed and defended in previous work.</small></p>

In this contribution, we present the hypothesis that syncopation is an effective strategy to elicit the bootstrapping of a multi-layered, hierarchically organized metric structure from a linear rhythmic surface. The hypothesis is inspired by a parallel with the problem of linearization in natural language syntax, which is the problem of how hierarchically organized phrase-structure markers are mapped onto linear sequences of words. The hypothesis has important consequences for the role of meter in music perception and cognition and, more particularly, for its role in the relationship between rhythm and bodily entrainment.</small></p>

Our proposal is based on a cognitively grounded notion of identity as identification of one object on the basis of the properties of another. We argue that our proposal is preferable over Russell's view that the copula is ambiguous between a predicative interpretation (as in “Socrates is wise”) and an equative one (as in “Socrates is a man”) but also improves upon Longobardi's and Moro's influential analyses, which entail that DP's are ambiguous between a referring type (e or et,t) and a predicational type (et). In the new analysis proposed here, copular structures receive a uniform predicational interpretations and DPs are uniformly interpreted as referential.</small></p>

This analysis has important across-the-board virtues. It reduces the distance between common nouns and names, under the insight that names are a highly specific case of a more general phenomenon consisting in the pragmatic modulation of the meaning of common nouns. It successfully ties to an important body of syntactic evidence, and contributes to elucidate, in an original and productive manner, many of the unsolved issues concerning the syntactic structure of (complex) names. Finally, it makes a number of philosophical puzzles virtually dissolve without giving up rigid reference for names, but crucially suggesting that the causal theory of reference becomes far-fetched once the linguistic structure of names and their actual use in language and cognition have been carefully evaluated.</small></p>

                <p><a href="URL" target="_blank">The linear structure of narrative figures in the Saint Francis Cycle: a linguistic analysis</a> (2022, w/Niels Boogers, Linda Badan, Giuseppe Samo)<br><small>This study examines the linear order of the narrative figures that appear in the frescoes of the Cycle of Saint Francis in the Upper Church of the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi, Italy (1288–1297). This linguistic analysis of the visual-pictorial modality explores the distribution of thematic and discourse roles as an authorly tool to express meaning. Findings include that the linear order of figures in the frescoes is patterned according to semantic principles and has been used here to convey particular relations, roles and other semantic information. Findings of this analysis can be fruitful both for the field of Art History and that of Linguistics, by offering insights into the potential application of linguistic patterning in narrative imagery, into the functions of artworks in this period, and how they combine their aesthetic, theological and communicative functions. The interdisciplinary methodology proposed here pioneers a new field of academic inquiry, for which future directives are provided.</small></p>

We build up on some of Frege's concerns about the first-person, recently revived by Kripke as a criticism of the position according to which Kaplan's two-dimensional semantics is all is needed for an adequate semantics of the first-person. First, we discuss the so-called pragmatic approach to Moore's paradox, discussing its possible limitations, in accordance with some ideas expressed on the matter by Shoemaker. Second, we show that sentences where a predicate expressing a “phenomenal” property combines with a first-person pronoun are bound to express Stalnaker's diagonal proposition, and are true a priori. Crucially, the proposition expressed does not correspond to the ascription of a property to an independently established object. Finally, we provide significant empirical evidence to the effect that this emerging “subjective” layer of meaning is actually what is needed to solve some of the puzzles around Moore's paradox: the status of Moore's sentences essentially depends, in fact, on the interaction between the “objective” and the “subjective” layers of meaning.</small></p>

According to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis, this phonological deficit is caused by deficient cerebellar function. In the current study, 26 adults with developmental dyslexia and 25 non-dyslexic participants underwent testing of reading-related skills, cerebellar functions, and MRI scanning of the brain. Anatomical assessment of the cerebellum was conducted with voxel-based morphometry. Behavioural evidence, that was indicative of impaired cerebellar function, was found to co-occur with reading impairments in the dyslexic subjects, but a causal relation between the two was not observed. No differences in local grey matter volume, nor in structure-function relationships within the cerebellum were found between the two groups. Possibly, the observed behavioural pattern is due to aberrant white matter connectivity. In conclusion, no support for the cerebellar deficit hypothesis or the presence of anatomical differences of the cerebellum in adults with developmental dyslexia was found.</small></p>

            <p>I love music, in all its forms and incarnations. In recent years, I have dedicated myself to composing and performing electronic music. I became especially interested in generative compositional processes and explorative/transcendental conceptions of musical practice. I make my music mainly using a modular synthesizer. Occasionaly I also play guitar, bass and drums. I'm cofounder of the artistic collective and digital label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundofatem" target="_blank">Effortless Art</a>.</p>
