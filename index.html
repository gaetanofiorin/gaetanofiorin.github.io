            <p>I study language as part of human cognition.</p>
            <p>My research interests are in theoretical linguistics (particularly model-theoretic semantics and the syntax-semantics interface), experimental linguistics (in particular, language development and language impairments) and the philosophy of language (in particular, the metaphysics of meaning and the interface between language and other cognitive system such as sensorial perception and music). I am professor of General Linguistics at the Department of Humanities (DISU) of the University of Trieste, Italy. I've studied at the University of Verona, Italy, and at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. I have also worked at Utrecht University from 2010 until 2022.</p>

This contribution supports the claim that binominal copulars are not ambiguous, while rejecting the familiar hypothesis that one of the DPs involved is necessarily a predicate. First, we show that binding of possessive pronouns is in fact generally allowed in binominal copulars, contrary to the received wisdom. Second, we show this to be compatible only with rejecting Longobardi and Moro’s small-clause analysis, whereby one of the two DPs is a predicate, and with adopting the view that the two DPs are related by an abstract head, which we interpret as a silent predicate of asymmetric identification. We further argue that the cases in which binding is illegitimate involve strict identity under pragmatic strengthening, whose result is semantically awkward and can only be rescued in pragmatically supportive contexts.</small></p>

Similarly to other pragmatic approaches to fiction and fictional contexts, we maintain that fictional texts require that the interpreter engages in a game of pretense of sort and are, therefore, prescriptions to imagine a state of affairs that is not the real one. In contrast to these approaches, however, we propose that interpreting a fictional text does not require imagining a set of possible state of affairs where the text would be true but, rather, requires imagining a set of possible contexts where the text would be meaningful. In order to apply this framework to fictional names, we adopt a contextual theory of proper names, which we have proposed and defended in previous work.</small></p>

In this contribution, we present the hypothesis that syncopation is an effective strategy to elicit the bootstrapping of a multi-layered, hierarchically organized metric structure from a linear rhythmic surface. The hypothesis is inspired by a parallel with the problem of linearization in natural language syntax, which is the problem of how hierarchically organized phrase-structure markers are mapped onto linear sequences of words. The hypothesis has important consequences for the role of meter in music perception and cognition and, more particularly, for its role in the relationship between rhythm and bodily entrainment.</small></p>

Our proposal is based on a cognitively grounded notion of identity as identification of one object on the basis of the properties of another. We argue that our proposal is preferable over Russell's view that the copula is ambiguous between a predicative interpretation (as in “Socrates is wise”) and an equative one (as in “Socrates is a man”) but also improves upon Longobardi's and Moro's influential analyses, which entail that DP's are ambiguous between a referring type (e or et,t) and a predicational type (et). In the new analysis proposed here, copular structures receive a uniform predicational interpretations and DPs are uniformly interpreted as referential.</small></p>

This analysis has important across-the-board virtues. It reduces the distance between common nouns and names, under the insight that names are a highly specific case of a more general phenomenon consisting in the pragmatic modulation of the meaning of common nouns. It successfully ties to an important body of syntactic evidence, and contributes to elucidate, in an original and productive manner, many of the unsolved issues concerning the syntactic structure of (complex) names. Finally, it makes a number of philosophical puzzles virtually dissolve without giving up rigid reference for names, but crucially suggesting that the causal theory of reference becomes far-fetched once the linguistic structure of names and their actual use in language and cognition have been carefully evaluated.</small></p>

                <p><a href="URL" target="_blank">The linear structure of narrative figures in the Saint Francis Cycle: a linguistic analysis</a> (2022, w/Niels Boogers, Linda Badan, Giuseppe Samo)<br><small>This study examines the linear order of the narrative figures that appear in the frescoes of the Cycle of Saint Francis in the Upper Church of the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi, Italy (1288–1297). This linguistic analysis of the visual-pictorial modality explores the distribution of thematic and discourse roles as an authorly tool to express meaning. Findings include that the linear order of figures in the frescoes is patterned according to semantic principles and has been used here to convey particular relations, roles and other semantic information. Findings of this analysis can be fruitful both for the field of Art History and that of Linguistics, by offering insights into the potential application of linguistic patterning in narrative imagery, into the functions of artworks in this period, and how they combine their aesthetic, theological and communicative functions. The interdisciplinary methodology proposed here pioneers a new field of academic inquiry, for which future directives are provided.</small></p>

We build up on some of Frege's concerns about the first-person, recently revived by Kripke as a criticism of the position according to which Kaplan's two-dimensional semantics is all is needed for an adequate semantics of the first-person. First, we discuss the so-called pragmatic approach to Moore's paradox, discussing its possible limitations, in accordance with some ideas expressed on the matter by Shoemaker. Second, we show that sentences where a predicate expressing a “phenomenal” property combines with a first-person pronoun are bound to express Stalnaker's diagonal proposition, and are true a priori. Crucially, the proposition expressed does not correspond to the ascription of a property to an independently established object. Finally, we provide significant empirical evidence to the effect that this emerging “subjective” layer of meaning is actually what is needed to solve some of the puzzles around Moore's paradox: the status of Moore's sentences essentially depends, in fact, on the interaction between the “objective” and the “subjective” layers of meaning.</small></p>

According to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis, this phonological deficit is caused by deficient cerebellar function. In the current study, 26 adults with developmental dyslexia and 25 non-dyslexic participants underwent testing of reading-related skills, cerebellar functions, and MRI scanning of the brain. Anatomical assessment of the cerebellum was conducted with voxel-based morphometry. Behavioural evidence, that was indicative of impaired cerebellar function, was found to co-occur with reading impairments in the dyslexic subjects, but a causal relation between the two was not observed. No differences in local grey matter volume, nor in structure-function relationships within the cerebellum were found between the two groups. Possibly, the observed behavioural pattern is due to aberrant white matter connectivity. In conclusion, no support for the cerebellar deficit hypothesis or the presence of anatomical differences of the cerebellum in adults with developmental dyslexia was found.</small></p>

We propose that control structures are the result of an operation of Thematic Overwriting (TO), which conflates two thematic roles into one and delivers a logical representation whereby two properties are predicated of a unique argument. The account we propose explains a number of facts concerning control structures: (i) The fact that control structures are bound to the expression of de se attitudes; (ii) that fact that some control structures – more precisely, those control structures involving an Experiencer subject – are bound to the expression of implicit de se attitudes, that is, de se propositional attitudes that are immune to error through misidentification; (iii) the contrast between optional and non-optional control; (iv) the contrast between partial and exhaustive control. The account we propose also predicts a diachronic constraint on the emergence of control structures, whereby TO first emerges in the context of implicit de se attitudes and only later is extended to other de se contexts. This prediction is supported by the attested development of control structures from Old English (OE) through early Modern English (ENE) and Middle English (ME) to Modern English.</small></p>

                <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/stul.12048" target="_blank">Italian echo-questions at the interface</a> (2017, w/Linda Badan, Stella Gryllia)<br><small>This paper investigates the prosodic, semantic and syntactic properties of fronted wh-echo questions (FWhEQs) in Italian, comparing them to information seeking wh-questions (WhQs). Results from a production experiment showed that the two differ prosodically: FWhEQs start low, rise later (the pitch accent was realized on the verb participle) and end with a high boundary tone, whereas WhQs in most of the cases start with a rise, followed by a small plateau and end with a rise or a low F0. At the syntactic level we argue that a FWhEQ moves as a whole to the specifier of a TopicP within a higher superordinate ForceP. At the semantic level, we propose that FWhEQs differ from regular WhQs in that they express a meta speech act: with a FWhEQ the speaker asks the addressee to repeat an assertion. We formalize this idea arguing that the movement of the whole ForceP to a higher ForceP, together with the obligatory final rising intonation, activates a REQUEST operator in the superordinate ForceP. The REQUEST operator is a meta speech act as it applies to another speech act, rather than to a sentence radical.</small></p>

This study looks at how young poor readers, speakers of Mandarin Chinese, comprehend affirmative and negative sentences as compared with a group of age-matched typical readers. Forty-four Chinese children were tested with a truth value judgment task. The results reveal that negative sentences were harder to process than affirmative ones, irrespective of the distinction between poor and typical readers. Moreover, poor readers performed worse than typical readers in comprehending sentences, regardless of whether they were affirmative or negative sentences. We interpret the results as (a) confirming the two-step simulation hypothesis, based on the result that the difficulty in processing negation has a general validity (persisting in pragmatically felicitous contexts), and (b) disconfirming that negation, as far as behavioral data are concerned, can be used as a reliable linguistic predictor of reading difficulties.</small></p>

                <p><a href="https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-3102-8" target="_blank">The semantics of person and de se effects in free indirect discourse</a> (2016, w/Denis Delfitto, Anne Reboul)<br><small>In this contribution we will address the main puzzling empirical issues that have been formulated around Free Indirect Discourse (FID): the constraints on the use of first person pronouns and of proper names (as well as of definite descriptions), the reasons why different grammatical features (person, gender, number) give rise to presuppositions that must be resolved at different levels of interpretation in FID, the factors that account for the observation that person and tense behave similarly in FID. At the same time, we will also discuss the main controversies to which the ongoing debate on FID has given rise in the literature, showing that Schlenker (Mind Lang 19(3):279–304, 2004)’s distinction between a Context of Thought (CT) and a Context of Utterance (CU) still provides a fundamentally valid insight into the nature of FID, in spite of many qualifications that are necessary and some well-motivated criticism. However, our main task here is more ambitious than simply taking a stand on the many unsettled controversies surrounding FID. In fact, we claim that Schlenker’s split between CU and CT can be derived in a principled way from the inner nature of FID as a linguistic process of ‘phenomenal identification’, whereby a Higher Experiencer attempts at reproducing (at a distinct time) the phenomenal experience proper to a Lower Experiencer. This distinction between qualitatively identified but numerically distinct experiences provides the conceptual basis for the derivation of virtually all remarkable properties of FID (including its somehow intermediate status between Direct and Indirect Discourse), while connecting, at the same time, with some intriguing semantic properties of first-person pronouns, such as the different varieties of de se readings.</small></p>
